}
// autoplay
// Sets whether or not the initial video will autoplay when the player loads.
	
// rel
// This parameter indicates whether the player should show related videos when playback of the initial video ends.

// autohide
// This parameter indicates whether the video controls will automatically hide after a video begins playing.
// autohide:2 - is for the video progress bar to fade out while the player controls (play button, volume control, etc.) remain visible.
// autohide:1 - then the video progress bar and the player controls will slide out of view a couple of seconds after the video starts playing. They will only reappear if the user moves her mouse over the video player or presses a key on her keyboard.
// autohide:0 - the video progress bar and the video player controls will be visible throughout the video and in fullscreen.
	
// showinfo
// If you set the parameter value to 0, then the player will not display information like the video title and uploader before the video starts playing.
// If the player is loading a playlist, and you explicitly set the parameter value to 1, then, upon loading, the player will also display thumbnail images for the videos in the playlist.
	
// controls
// This parameter indicates whether the video player controls will display. It also defines when the controls display in the player as well as when the player will load:
// controls:0 – Player controls do not display in the player. For IFrame embeds, the Flash player loads immediately.
// controls:1 – Player controls display in the player. For IFrame embeds, the controls display immediately and the Flash player also loads immediately.
// controls:2 – Player controls display in the player. For IFrame embeds, the controls display and the Flash player loads after the user initiates the video playback.
	
// fs
// fs:1 - causes the fullscreen button to display. 
// fs:0 - prevents the fullscreen button from displaying.
	
// modestbranding
// This parameter lets you use a YouTube player that does not show a YouTube logo. 
// Set the parameter value to 1 to prevent the YouTube logo from displaying in the control bar. 
// Note that a small YouTube text label will still display in the upper-right corner of a paused video when the user's mouse pointer hovers over the player.
	
// iv_load_policy
// Setting to 1 will cause video annotations to be shown by default, whereas setting to 3 will cause video annotations to not be shown by default.

// This event fires whenever a player has finished loading and is ready to begin receiving API calls. 
function onPlayerReady(event)
{
	event.target.setPlaybackQuality('hd720');
	event.target.playVideo();
}
// This event fires if an error occurs in the player.
function onPlayerError(event)
{
	//event.data == 2 – The request contains an invalid parameter value. For example, this error occurs if you specify a video ID that does not have 11 characters, or if the video ID contains invalid characters, such as exclamation points or asterisks.
	//event.data == 5 – The requested content cannot be played in an HTML5 player or another error related to the HTML5 player has occurred.
	//event.data == 100 – The video requested was not found. This error occurs when a video has been removed (for any reason) or has been marked as private.
	//event.data == 101 – The owner of the requested video does not allow it to be played in embedded players.
	//event.data == 150 – This error is the same as 101. It's just a 101 error in disguise!
