{texturequality

	; Numbers 0, 1, 2 etc. are the number of top MIP levels to drop
	; So correspondingly the texture resolution is reduced by 0, 2, 4 and so on times

	; 1. The preset name corresponds to localization key under "options/video/texture"
	; 2. {Default} line sets the number of MIP levels dropped by default
	; 3. Other lines set dropped MIP levels for corresponding texture folders,
	;    this way one can set the texture quality other than default (either lower or higher)
	; 4. Presets are shown in game options in order of appearance in this file


	; all textures get top two MIP levels dropped
